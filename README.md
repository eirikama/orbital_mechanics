# Orbital mechanics
Solving the **N-body problem** using either **forth order Runge Kutta** or symplectic **Verlet integration** to solve the differential equations. We can either use **Newtonian** or **relativistic** mechanics.


Apply the solver to the planets of our solar system (+ good ol' Pluto and Halley's comet), to calculate their motion.
